#+title: Emacs tips

This is a collection of tips I have accumulated over my Emacs journey.

* Python
** Showing the documentation at point
Execute the command =jedi:show-doc= (by default, bound to =C-c ?=).
* Common Lisp
** Enable concurrent hints
When hacking a Lisp program as it runs (like a SDL window), the
function hints in the bottom bar are not working. Run this function to
fix it (courtesy of Baggers):
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun slime-enable-concurrent-hints ()
    (interactive)
    (setf slime-inhibit-pipelining nil))
#+end_src
